<H1><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> Implementation of BMP classes</H1>
<p>
Included in this directory are a set of classes for manipulating Microsoft's BMP file format.
Microsoft's <a href="http://atlc.sourceforge.net/bmp.html">specification</a> outlines the 
basics of what a BMP is and what it contains.
<p>
This set of classes (written in pure Ruby) was designed to open, manipulate (on a very low level),
report on a BMP and hide data within a BMP. This last item is referred to as 
<a href="http://www.jjtc.com/Steganography/">steganography</a>. The BMP classes, of course, can
easily be extended to do useful work and because they are written in a Ruby which is an 
interpreted language they are not very fast (compared to C) but they are concise, and easy to
extend to other purposes.
<p>
The BMP classes were designed as an object lesson for learning Ruby and come with no guarantee.
The classes are easy to implement and work on regular (non-icon), uncompressed BMPs. Compression
will be handled at a later date.
<P>
Briefly, these classes allow you to hide data within a graphic. How this is done takes place 
on a byte by byte level, but some interesting points about this technique are that the BMP
looks like the original to all but the most rigorous examinations and the BMP with 
embedded data is exactly the same size as the original. This implementation includes a trivial
password system to 'protect' the data (a more robust implementation is left as an exercise to
the reader).
